# Predicting Temperatures Mini Project

This repository contains the notebook for a project as part of my Master's degree studies.

The notebook can be opened in [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/daniilgaltsev/predicting_temperatures_mini_project/blob/main/predict_temperatures.ipynb?hl=en). Since data is downloaded dymnamically, it is possible to play around with the data on your own, but it is important that there might have been changes in the data, which are not handled.
